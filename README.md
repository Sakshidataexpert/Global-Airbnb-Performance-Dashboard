## Features / Highlights
## • Business Problem

As Airbnb expanded globally, understanding growth patterns, market concentration, pricing structures, and host quality became critical. However, raw marketplace data makes it difficult to answer questions such as:

• Which cities dominate the Airbnb market?

• How did the platform grow from 2010 to profitability?

• Are regulatory policies affecting listing supply?

• Which cities deliver the best guest experience?

• How does pricing impact listing distribution?

## • Goal of the Dashboard

To create an interactive analytical tool that:

• Tracks Airbnb’s growth and profitability trends

• Measures market concentration across cities

• Analyzes pricing dynamics by listing type

• Evaluates trust and quality metrics

• Identifies regulatory impacts on listing growth
